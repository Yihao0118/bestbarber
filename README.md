## Installation
I recommend you to use **Visual Studio Code**.


### Windows

1. Clone this repo.
2. Use a terminal inside VSCode: Create a virtual environment using
```bash
python virtualenv venv 

# Check if you have venv folder after you type this command.
# If you do, it means that it worked
```

3. Activate your virtual environment
```bash
cd venv && Scripts/activate
```
4. Check if your terminal has this prefix: (venv) If so, it worked.

5. Install required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. Now check if you can run the project.
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
